# spacetrader_agent
For developing code related to the [spacetraders.io game](https://spacetraders.io/).

## What does this code do?
This is a client that can be used to play the "SpaceTraders" game. It wraps the API endpoints in a set of commands that are more easily usable from the command line or a Python Notebook (end goal is to create a nicer interface as well).
It also offers some additional features like locally caching game data to limit API usage and keeping the player's API token somewhat protected via a password.

The end goal is to make this game easier to play.

## How do I use this code?
(TBD - once I have a basic interface, I will ideally have 1 command to run to boot up the game and the interface. Once I have this, describe this setup process here).

## Notes:
- Spacetraders.io does offer a software development kit (SDK), but I would prefer to create the architecture myself - so I will not be using it.
